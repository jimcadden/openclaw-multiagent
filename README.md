# openclaw-multiagent

Multi-agent workspace toolkit for OpenClaw. Distributed via Git submodules.

## What's This?

A collection of skills and templates for running multiple OpenClaw agents with shared state management, git tracking, and easy Telegram setup.

## When to Use This

**Bootstrap is for fresh OpenClaw installs.** Run it once after installing OpenClaw and before creating any agents.

**Already have OpenClaw set up?** Skip bootstrap — just add this repo as a submodule to your existing workspace and repoint your skill symlinks.

## Quick Start (New Install)

```bash
# 1. Create your workspace
mkdir -p ~/workspaces
cd ~/workspaces
git init

# 2. Add this repo as a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/jimcadden/openclaw-multiagent.git kit

# 3. Run bootstrap (one-time setup)
./kit/skills/multiagent-bootstrap/scripts/setup.sh

# 4. Restart OpenClaw
openclaw gateway restart
```

## What's Included

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `multiagent-bootstrap` | One-time setup script — creates first agent, wires up config |
| `multiagent-state-manager` | Git workflow for committing workspace changes |
| `multiagent-telegram-setup` | Interactive Telegram bot creation |
| `workspace-template/` | Starter files for new agents (SOUL.md, USER.md, etc.) |

## Creating Additional Agents

After bootstrap, adding agents is manual (for now):

```bash
cd ~/workspaces
cp -r kit/workspace-template my-new-agent
# Edit my-new-agent/IDENTITY.md, USER.md, etc.
# Add to openclaw.json
# Restart OpenClaw
```

## Updating the Kit

```bash
cd ~/workspaces/kit
git pull
cd ..
git add kit
git commit -m "[main] Update multiagent kit"
```

## Structure

```
